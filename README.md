# ECommerce Customers Segmentation Using K-means clustering

## Problem Statement

Online retail is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
In short, it's a one-year data for a UK-based based company 💂‍♂️. Selling unique all occasion gifts.
